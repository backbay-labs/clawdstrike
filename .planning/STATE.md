# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** Analysts fly a ship through an immersive space environment to reach floating stations — the journey between stations is as engaging as the destination
**Current focus:** Phase 20 — Spatial Foundation (ready to plan)

## Current Position

Phase: 20 of 26 (Spatial Foundation)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-20 — v6.0 roadmap created, 40 requirements mapped across 7 phases (20-26)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 10: Install `@react-three/postprocessing` + `postprocessing` via `bun add` in apps/workbench; ESM-only, Vite handles transparently
- Phase 10: `EffectComposer` needs `frameBufferType={THREE.HalfFloatType}` for HDR bloom; `multisampling={0}` + `gl={{ antialias: false }}` on Canvas
- Phase 10: Effect order is mandatory — Bloom → DOF/Autofocus → Vignette → ChromaticAberration → LUT → ToneMapping → SMAA
- Phase 12: Install `wawa-vfx` (already in deps); probe discharge is custom InstancedMesh; ambient motes use drei Sparkles; spirit trail uses drei Trail
- Phase 14: NPCs via drei Instances + Instance; waypoint beacons via Billboard + Text (NOT Html — perf trap)
- v6.0 roadmap: WebGPU renderer swap is a one-liner task in Phase 20, not a requirement — treated as a constraint/implementation detail
- v6.0 roadmap: FLT-06 thruster VFX uses wawa-vfx (already installed from Phase 12); SPC-06 lane particles also wawa-vfx
- [Phase 20-spatial-foundation]: WebGPU attempted via import(three/webgpu) async; WebGL2 fallback with logarithmicDepthBuffer=true — prevents Z-fighting at 300-unit space scale
- [Phase 20-spatial-foundation]: WORLD_RADIUS=300 in observatory-world-template.ts; station positions include elevationY baked in so all consumers (camera, NPC, hero props) get correct Y without offset
- [Phase 20-spatial-foundation]: StationBuilding/DistrictGround/DistrictEnvProps removed from scene — districtGeometry.tsx preserved for mulberry32 used by Plan 02 SpaceStationMesh

### Blockers/Concerns

- jsdom prints non-failing warnings for raw R3F tag casing in `observatory-ghost-layer.test.tsx`
- Some Three.js-based tests print a non-failing multiple-instances warning in the Vitest environment
