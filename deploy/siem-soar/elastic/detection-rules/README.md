# Elastic Security detection rule templates

These JSON files are **templates** based on the examples in `docs/plans/siem-soar/elastic.md`.

Elastic’s Kibana UI typically imports/exports detection rules as NDJSON; you may need to copy/paste fields into a new rule or adapt these templates to your Kibana version.
