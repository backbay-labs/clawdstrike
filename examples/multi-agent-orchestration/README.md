# Multi-Agent Orchestration (Example)

This example demonstrates baseline multi-agent primitives:

- Agent identities (Ed25519)
- Signed delegation tokens (capability grants)
- Signed messages with replay protection hooks

It is a teaching example (no NATS/Kafka required).

## Run

```bash
cd examples/multi-agent-orchestration
cargo run
```
